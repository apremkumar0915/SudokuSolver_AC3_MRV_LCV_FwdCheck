## SudokuSolver_AC3_MRV_LCV_FwdCheck
Personal project to create a sudoku solver by treating it as a constraint search problem. An application of concepts learned in CS486 (Berkeley's CS-188 Course). Includes implementation of enforcing arc consistency (AC-3), forward checking, utilizing the minimum remaining values heuristic as well as least constraining value heuristic. The underlying algorithm for solving each puzzle was backtracking (a variant of depth-first search where constraints are checked before and after each assignment). Includes a timetable of each algorithm's performance measured by the cumulative time taken to complete 1000 puzzles and the number of times needed to backtrack to solve.
